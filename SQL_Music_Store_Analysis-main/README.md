The first set of questions (Easy) asks about the senior most employee, the countries with the most invoices, the top 3 values of total invoice, the city with the best customers, and the best customer. 

The second set of questions (Moderate) asks about the rock music listeners, the top 10 rock bands, the songs that have a song length longer than the average song length, and the amount spent by each customer on artists.

The third set of questions (Advance) asks about the most popular music genre for each country, the customer that has spent the most on music for each country, and the customer who has spent the most money on music.

The project is designed to help the music store understand their customers, their invoices, and their tracks. The project can also be used to identify trends in the music industry.
